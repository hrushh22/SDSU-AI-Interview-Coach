# Voice Recording Fixes - AI Interview Coach

## 🎯 ISSUES FIXED

### 1. Recording Stops on Pause ✅
**Problem**: Audio recording stopped when user paused for 2-5 seconds
**Solution**: Replaced `audio-recorder-streamlit` with `streamlit-audiorecorder`
- **New Package**: `streamlit-audiorecorder` handles pauses better
- **Behavior**: Recording continues during natural speech pauses
- **Interface**: Clear START/STOP buttons instead of single toggle

### 2. Missing Submit Functionality ✅
**Problem**: No way to submit voice recordings for AI feedback
**Solution**: Added complete voice-to-feedback workflow
- **Step 1**: Record audio with START/STOP buttons
- **Step 2**: Click "Transcribe Audio" to convert speech to text
- **Step 3**: Review transcribed text (with edit option)
- **Step 4**: Click "Submit Voice Answer" to get AI feedback

### 3. Question Cycling Issue ✅
**Problem**: Same question repeated instead of advancing
**Solution**: Fixed next question logic
- **Root Cause**: API wasn't properly incrementing question index
- **Fix**: Updated "Next Question" button to properly load next question
- **Result**: Each question advance shows different question from bank
